# Issue Templates

This folder contains templates to help contributors report issues clearly and effectively.

## Bug Report Template

When a user encounters a problem or bug, the **bug_report.md** template provides a structured form to report it. This ensures that important information such as:

- What the user did
- What happened
- Expected behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

is collected to help maintainers understand and fix the issue quickly.

Using templates improves communication and speeds up issue resolution.
